    Edmond J. Safra Center for Bioinformatics,
    Blavatnik School of Computer Science, Tel Aviv University.
    Supervised by Dr. Roded Sharan
    {
    Used computational tools to study the biological features of protein interactions
    - Defined and computed interaction level and conservation level of protein interactions;
    - Validated our hypothesis about the relationship between protein interaction and
    evolution;
    - Made a discovery in the biological features of protein interaction;
